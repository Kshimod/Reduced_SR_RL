## ------ About this file ------ ##
This file contains codes for running simulations and generating figures on our manuscript "Rigid Reduced Successor Represenation as a Potential Mechanism for Addiction".
The manuscript is the revised version of the previous one ("Reduced Successor Representation Potentially Interferes with Cessation of Habitual Reward-Seeking"), which is available on bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.15.297655v2).


## ------ How to generate data and figures ------ ##
First, please run all of the "**.py" or "**.ipynb" files to generate folders and csv files.
Then, running "Figure_Plot.R" will generate figures in the corresponding folders.
